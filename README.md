BACKGROUND:
Booking a hotel room is a very time-consuming process if you are travelling to some new place.
The traditional way of booking a room was a walk-in system where you check for room
availability beforehand and must book rooms with high prices. Comparing different options is
also a difficult task. Hence, such database management system will help users to lookup for
hotels and available rooms of their preferred location, check in-out date and compare different
options and choose the one best for their needs. Moreover, they can cancel their booking and
issue refund if there are any change of plans.
